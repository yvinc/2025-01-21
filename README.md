# 2025-01-21 Branch Conflict

-   Last time we talked about branching.

-   Today we focus on something that'll be similar to what's to be expected in the project.

    -   Branches come from the same source, where the branches may or may not have conflicts.

-   (recall ls -a shows also the hidden files)

-   `git switch -c`, where c stands for 'create'.

    -   Instead of needing to run `git branch` and `git switch`.

    -   Keeping track of where `HEAD` is would be a crucial thing to know where your current position is with `git log â€”oneline`.

-   git switch -c <NAME> will create a new branch and switch to it.
